Group14 Final Project - DnD Simulator
## Summary

DnD stands for Dungeons & Dragons, which is a popular tabletop role-playing game. Many people are obsessed with this game, but there are also many people who are not familiar with it. One of the reasons for this is people don't want to read the rules. Although DnD allows for players to use their imagination, there are over 300 pages of rules for this game. Our project is to create a "mini" DnD for people to get used to the basic process of this game and learn the rules while playing it.
