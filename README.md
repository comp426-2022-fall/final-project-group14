# COMP 426-a99: Group 14 Final Project - DnD Simulator
## Summary

DnD stands for Dungeons & Dragons, which is a popular tabletop role-playing game. Many people are obsessed with this game, but there are also many people who are not familiar with it. One of the reasons for this is people don't want to read the rules. Although DnD allows for players to use their imagination, there are over 300 pages of rules for this game. Our project is to create a "mini" DnD for people to get used to the basic process of this game and learn the rules while playing it.

## Demo

Here is the link for our demo to help you understand how this simulator works.

## Set up

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` in command line to install all dependencies. All dependencies we used are located in `package.json` file.
3. Run `npm start` to start the simulator
4. Go to the webpage `localhost:3000/`
5. Stop the server using `Ctr+C`

## Planning
All the meeting details and progress details are located in [this file](../main/docs/plan.md). We actively used GitHub features such as fork, merge, and pull to complete these projects.

## Team Roles
We have 3 members in our team. We divided our works evenly and often helped each other when we got stuck. [Here](../main/docs/roles.md) is the specific team roles we have individually.

## API Explained
Because our simulator is a small game, we have many API endpoints. [Here](../main/docs/api_explained.md) is the link that give specific explainations for each part.

## What's Next
Due to the final season and the time constraint, we don't have the time and the energy to push this simulator to perfection. This is the [link](../main/docs/whatsnext.md) explaining what our next steps.
