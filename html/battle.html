  <h1>Encounter 2: Battle amidst the storm</h1>
  <p>
    You emerge from the snowstorm into a wooded glade. 
    You can faintly see a rustic cottage within this glade—but you can most definitely hear the sounds of bestial roars and battle cries. 
    You can just barely see a huge man with a massive greatsword fending off a hulking, white-furred beast.

  <p>
    A neutral good human berserker named Alvan Shorthelm is battling a winter wolf about thirty feet away from you. 
    This cottage is his, and he was forced out of it in the midst of this storm to defend it from wolves. One already lies dead, its red blood staining the snow around it, while the other fights on. 
    Alvan is badly wounded (he has only 15 hit points remaining), and the other wolf is at full hit points. If you don’t intervene, he will surely die.
