            <h3>The Icebreaker, wounded after she was attacked in the icy seas of the Sword Coast North, has just arrived in Fireshear harbor. 
                Captain Silvermane barks orders from the helm, commanding the vessel to be docked at a shipyard on the far side of the harbor. 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                As you pull into the shipyard, you see a pair of familiar faces: the duergar Griggle Duskloch, a smith who accidentally unleashed a swarm of mephits in Fireshear a tenday ago, and Kalannai Grayfur, the human community leader who helped the people of Fireshear withstand the chaos. 
                Both raise a hand to you in greeting as you walk down the gangplank.
            </h3>
