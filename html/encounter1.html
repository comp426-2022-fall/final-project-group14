        <h2>
            Your trouble begins some ten miles away from Hundelstone, on a gray, overcast afternoon. 
        </h2>
        <h2>
            The gray clouds covering the sky promise snowâ€”and likely a storm...
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Snowflakes begin to fall within the hour, and grow thicker and thicker in the next few hours of travel 
            until it's difficult for you to see even thirty feet ahead of them through the torrent of snowfall. 
            You need to hurry toward Hundelstone, but the Ten Trail is almost completely invisible beneath the snowfall.
        </h3>
