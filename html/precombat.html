  <h2>Even though you try to hide, you are seen by the wolf. The wolf stares at you with red lights shining in its eyes. You are forced to join this combat.</h2>  
  <h3>Because you join the fight passively, you missed the chance to possibly surprise the wolf. If you want to know how surprise works, try pick the other option next time. For now, you will directly go to the next step.</h3>
