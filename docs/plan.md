## Before we met
We read the instructions and rubric for a99 and brainstormed for possible topics.

## Meeting 1 - Nov 25
We decided to make a prototype about Dungeons & Dragons. Since some of the team didn't know about the game before, we learned about the game together and looked for a storyline that could be used in our website. 

We planned to finish an outline for the website before next meeting. The outline should include not only major components of our website, such as log-in, Encounter 1, and Encounter 2, but also specific designs for the game, so that it can act as a to-do list in the future.

## Meeting 2 - Nov 26
We finished the and discussed some confusions during the meeting. We got two suitable API for our prototype. 

The plans before next meeting is to come up with basic codes. Guning Shen is responsible for User Log-in, Xinyue Xing is responsible for Background and Encounter 1, and Wenjing Huang is responsible for Encounter 2.

## Meeting 3 - Dec 1
The goal of this meeting is to come up with a plan for what we will do in the following days. We went through the current website together and found some minor problems that could be improved.

We planned to finish the whole coding part by Dec 6, and discussed about the front-end design together.
