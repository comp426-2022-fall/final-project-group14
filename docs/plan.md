## Before we met
We read the instructions and rubric for a99 and brainstormed for possible topics.

## Meeting 1 - Nov 25
We decided to make a prototype of Dungeons & Dragons. Since some of the team didn't know about the game before, we learned about the game together and looked for a storyline that could be used on our website. 

We planned to finish an outline for the website before the next meeting. The outline should include not only major components of our website, such as log-in, Encounter 1, and Encounter 2 but also specific designs for the game so that it can act as a to-do list in the future.

## Meeting 2 - Nov 26
We finished the outline and discussed some changes we made. We got two suitable APIs for our prototype. 

The plan before the next meeting is to come up with basic codes. Guning Shen is responsible for User Log-in, Xinyue Xing is responsible for Background and Encounter 1, and Wenjing Huang is responsible for Encounter 2.

## Meeting 3 - Dec 1
The goal of this meeting is to come up with a plan for what we will do in the following days. We went through the current website together and found some minor problems that could be improved.

We planned to finish the whole coding part by Dec 6 and discussed the front-end design together.

## Meeting 4 -Dec 6
Before this meeting, we finished most of the coding including the database. The goal of this meeting is to bring up any confusion or misunderstanding that needs to be clarified before we record our demo.

The plan before the meeting on Dec 7 is to wrap everything up, including documentation, so that we can prepare and record the demo video next meeting.

## Outside the meetings
We also communicate via group chat about minor issues to ensure consistency among the group. This promotes the effciency of accomplishing tasks, since we changes our plan accordingly as all the information is up-to-date.
