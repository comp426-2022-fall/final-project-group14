# What's next
The actual DnD game is much more complicated than what we currently have. And we have a lot of parts that can be added to the simulator for users to get more familiar with this game.

## Character setup
In the future, we can add more classes and races, and set up more equipment for players to select. There are many other attributes like proficiencies, experience points, gold pieces, and weapons. All of these add-ons can make the game more real and closer to the actual game.

## Encounters
We only set up two encounters in our simulator, and explain one of the most important parts of the game: combat. However, there are much more activities a player can do in the actual game, such as adventures, social interactions, and so on. In the future, we can set up a page that allows the user to go through the activity he/she wants so that the player can learn the rules of a particular activity. Furthermore, we can design a short story for each activity so that users can play DnD even without finding a bunch of friends.

## Combat
Even though we explicitly explain the basic structure of combat, there are many details we can cover in the future. 
One of them is the magic part. In the world of DnD, some classes and races can spell cast towards the environment and the enemy. And the magical part of DnD is also one of the most interesting parts. We can add this feature to the simulator in the future.
Another is the environment of the combat. In our simulator, the environment is a small, cold cabin. However, there are many interesting environments such as underwater or a big castle where the player can utilize the environment to take more actions. Our next step includes a way to let players expand their imagination and type in what they are going to do. And we can give responses given their typed-in information. In this way, players can actually experience the creativity of DnD.
