## Review Manager & Plan Manager & Project Manager

The team size is quite small and communication is convenient through group chat. We also keep track of the whole project and test the collaboration within the system at the beginning of every meeting. We constantly update on our progress and assign tasks according to different schedules. There is almost no conflict among our tasks, and everyone is on the same page. Therefore, we are all review managers, plan managers, and project managers.

## Documentation Manager

Xinyue Xing and Wenjing Huang will finish all the documentation together. Then, Xinyue Xing will double-check at the end to keep the documentation in order and identify what is missing and needs to be documented.

## Release Manager

Wenjing Huang will record our demo, manage the packaging and release process for our prototype package.

## Front end lead & Back end lead

We divided the project into three major parts.
Guning Shen will take charge of log-in and character selection.
Xinyue Xing will take charge of the background and Encounter 1.
Wenjing Huang will take charge of Encounter 2 and the ending.
For the front end of this prototype, we will discuss the design first and apply it to different parts separately, since each of us is familiar with different parts.

## Database lead

Guning Shen will be the database lead and ensure the functionality of the database. 

## Design Lead

Guning Shen will be the design lead.
